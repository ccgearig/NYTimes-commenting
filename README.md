My program iterates over lists of 25 New York Times comments and 25 New York Times Facebook comments.

From these lists, which are fetched from APIs, my program displays the following information:

-The average length of Facebook and article comments
-How many comments in each list are longer than 250 characters, and the number of characters in the longest comments in each list
-If there are more positive words in article comments or Facebook comments
-If there are more negative words in article comments or Facebook comments


My program uses these modules: facebook, json and requests.

To run the program, you must insert a new Facebook API access token which can be found here: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/145634995501895/?method=GET&path=nytimes%2Ffeed&version=v2.5

My program also prints out results of test cases showing that they are successful.
